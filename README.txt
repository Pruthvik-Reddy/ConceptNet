To run :

1. get_analogies.py -> python3 get_analogies.py [man] [boy] [woman]
 - It needs three arguments i.e three words as input to solve analogy problem. 

2. Word Sense Disambiguation : Conceptnet does not include "sense_labels" for all nodes. It only has them for few. 
- In some cases, word senses are only distinguished by using parts of speech which is bare minimum.
